title: "Why a CSS alternative to &lt;select&gt; is impossible"
---

A couple of weeks ago, I came across an article from Pepsized featuring a [CSS-only alternative to the Select Element](http://pepsized.com/css-only-alternative-to-the-select-element/). Sounds nice! Especially since I recall doing some [dropdown styling at Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/10/04/custom-drop-down-list-styling/).

Yeah, it's very nice. Even if it's not an alternative to the Select Element. This is not possible. You cannot do a pure CSS alternative to the Select Element.

There is more than just a click on a button opening a list of options to the `<select>` element. It involves accessibility, usability, processing, shadow DOM and a lot of various options. A lot of things that CSS can't do. That **CSS isn't supposed to do**.

Now don't get me wrong, the author at Pepsized did a wonderful job on this article, regarding both the design and the usability (which is far better than what I did at Codrops). (S)He is a good CSS developer, I don't even question that. But once again, (s)he didn't provide a CSS alternative to the `<select>` element. Let me clear things up point per point.

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">You can't do a CSS alternative to the Select element.</blockquote>

## Accessibility

The major concern here is **accessibility**. The default `<select>` element is completely usable either with a mouse or a keyboard, following this process:

1. Mouse: move your cursor over the `<select>` element  
	Keyboard: use the tab key to focus the `<select>` element
1. Mouse: click on the `<select>` element  
	Keyboard: press enter
1. Mouse: move your cursor over the desired option  
	Keyboard: use the top and bottom arrow keys to pick an option
1. Mouse: click on the desired option  
	Keyboard: press enter

While making a pure CSS dropdown easily usable with the mouse can be done by pretty much any one with some CSS knowledge, making it usable with keyboard navigation is a whole other story.

However, it's doable. You won't have exactly the same process as above, but you'll probably be able to pick your option with the arrow keys and such.

Anyway, this introduces some new behaviour (you may call this inconsistencies) for people who can't use a mouse. Yes, not having to press enter (steps 2 and 4) is probably no big deal for you and I, but for &mdash; let's say &mdash; a blind user, it may be confusing.

## Mobile devices

Mobile devices can become another problem with a home-made `<select>` element. Mobile devices often mean touch events. There is no more mouse. There is no more keyboard. Now there is a finger.

In most cases, making a custom dropdown accessible for mobile users will take no more than just a few lines of CSS. Basically it requires to change all the hover states by focus states to make things work.

But **making things work is not always enough**. Mobile browsers have a very efficient way to handle select dropdowns natively enabling scrolling gestures. When facing a `<select>` with dozens of options like a dropdown to pick your country, having a mobile-friendly UI can make the difference between a user who buy/subscribe and a user who leave.

## Processing

In most cases, as a developer you will use a `<select>` element because you want your users to pick an option; option that you will want to use for your database, your email, or whatever.

Since the `<select>` element is a form element, it comes with a name attribute and the ability to send POST or GET data through a form. This means you can access the selected option by no more than `$_POST['name-of-select-element']` in PHP. With JavaScript, it will probably be something like `document.getElementById('name-of-select-element').value;`.

Fine. Now let's do this with CSS only. Uh-ho, not possible. If you're clever enough, you'll come up with a solution involving hidden radio inputs within your list items. Sounds fair enough; so... you end up using multiple form elements... not to use a form element. Right?

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">You end up using multiple form elements not to use a form element.</blockquote>

Let's say you don't mind the extra-processing that comes with the multiple radio buttons compared to the regular `<select>` element... 

## Native options

... what if you want to give your user the ability to select multiple options? Okay, you could still use checkboxes, that sounds legit.

Then let's talk about other options like: `required`, `disabled` and `autofocus`.

I can think of a workaround for `disabled` with a class on the parent element, using pointer-events to disable clicking on items. Okay.

If you come up with a CSS-only solution to force the user to select an option by preventing form submit and displaying a warning message instead, I'd be more than glad to hear it!

You could still use JavaScript. But then:

* it's no more a CSS-only alternative to the `<select>` element
* it adds even more code to your page, slowing it down

## Performance

Even if it's not much a concern, using a HTML/CSS "alternative" to the `<select>` element means using at least a dozen of DOM nodes (quickly ramping up with the number of options) and maybe about 50 lines of CSS, perhaps including some heavy CSS properties like shadows or gradients.

Okay, it's no big deal when you know the average page size is a little over 1.4Mb (according to [HTTP Archive](http://www.httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage)).

But still, you could have used a single element (including Shadow DOM) and 0 line of CSS for a result which beats your alternative on all points except on design (and this is yet to be determined).

## Be native

Browser makers spend countless hours building native support for a lot of things in order to improve both user's experience and developer's life. Use these native features.

Please, don't screw accessibility, performance and usability for design purpose. Those things should always come first.
