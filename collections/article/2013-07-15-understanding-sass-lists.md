title: "Understanding Sass lists"
---

Lists have to be the most complicated and vicious thing in the whole Sass language. The main problem with lists -if a problem it is- is that the syntax is way too permissive. You can do pretty much whatever you want.

Anyway, I recently had the opportunity to write [an article for CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/striped-background-gradients/) about a Sass function involving quite a lot of list manipulation. I introduced the topic by clearing a couple of things regarding Sass lists but I wanted to write a more in-depth article.

## Creating a Sass list

First things first. Even creating a Sass list can be tricky. Indeed, Sass isn't very strict with variable types. Basically it means you can process a list quite like a string, or use list functions to a string. It is basically a mess.

Anyway, we have a couple of ways to initialize an empty variable (that could be treated as a list):

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">Sass isn't very strict with variable type.</blockquote>

```scss
$a: ();
$b: unquote('');
$c: null;
$d: (null);
```

Now we have defined our variables, we will check their type. Just for fun.

```scss
type-of($a) -> list
type-of($b) -> string
type-of($c) -> null
type-of($d) -> null
```

Since `$c` and `$d` are stricly equivalent, we will remove the later from the next tests. Let's check the length of each variable.

```scss
length($a) -> 0
length($b) -> 1
length($c) -> 1
```

`$a` being 0 item long is what we would have expected since it is an empty list. String being 1 item long isn't that odd either since it is a string. However the `null` variable being 1 item long is kind of weird; more on this later.

## Sass list "fun" facts

This section has been quickly covered in the article at CSS-Tricks but since it is the very basics I have to put this here as well.

**You can use spaces or commas as separator.** Even if I feel more comfortable with commas since it is the classic separator for arrays (JavaScript, PHP...).

```scss
$list-space: "item-1" "item-2" "item-3";
$list-comma: "item-1", "item-2", "item-3";
```

*Note: As in CSS, you can ommit quotes for your strings as long as they don't contain any special characters. So `$list: item-1, item-2, item-3` is perfectly valid.*

**You can nest lists.** As for JavaScript or any other language, there is no limit regarding the level of depth you can have with nested lists. Just go as deep as you need to, bro. 

```scss
/* Nested lists with braces and same separator */
$list: ( 
    ("item-1.1", "item-1.2", "item-1.3"), 
        ("item-2.1", "item-2.2", "item-2.3"),
        ("item-3.1", "item-3.2", "item-3.3")
       );
       
/* Nested lists without braces using different separators to distinguish levels */
$list: "item-1.1" "item-1.2" "item-1.3", 
       "item-2.1" "item-2.2" "item-2.3",
       "item-3.1" "item-3.2" "item-3.3";
```


**You can ommit braces** (as you can guess from the previous example). You can define a non-empty list without any braces if you feel so. This is because -contrarily to what most people think- [braces are not what create lists](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/837#issuecomment-20429965) in Sass (except when empty); it is the delimiter (see below). Braces are a just a grouping mecanism.

*Note: This is the theory. I've noticed braces are not just a grouping mecanism. When manipulating matrices (4/5+ levels of nesting), braces are definitely not optional. This is too complicated for today though, we'll dig into this in another blog post.*

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">Manipulating 5+ nested lists is a pain in the ass.</blockquote>

```scss
$list: "item-1", "item-2", "item-3";
```

**Indexes start at 1, not 0.** This is one of the most disturbing once you start experimenting with Sass lists. Plus it makes a lot of things pretty complicated (cf CSS-Tricks article).

```scss
nth($list, 0) -> throws error
nth($list, 1) -> "item-1"
```

**Every value in Sass is treated as a list.** Strings, numbers, boolean, whatever you can put in a variable. This means you're fine to use some list functions even on things that don't look like one.

```scss
$variable: "Sass is awesome";
length($variable) -> 1
```

*Beware! If you remove the quotes around this string, it will be parsed as a 3 items long list (1: Sass; 2: is; 3: awesome). I recommand you quotes your strings to avoid some unpleasant surprises.*

## Sass list functions

Before getting into the real topic, let's make a round-up on Sass list functions.

**`length($list)`**: returns the length of a `$list` (if not a list, returns 1).

**`nth($list, $index)`**: returns the value at `$index` position in `$list` (throw an error if index out of list range).

**`index($list, $value)`**: returns the first index of the searched for `$value` in `$list` (false if not found).

**`append($list, $value[, $separator])`**: appends `$value` to the end of `$list` using `$separator` as a separator (using the current one if not specified).

**`join($list-1, $list-2[, $separator])`**: appends `$list-2` to `$list-1` using `$separator` as a separator (using the one from the first list if not specified). 

**`zip(*$lists)`**: combines several list into a comma-separated list where the nth value is a space-separated lists of all source lists nth values. In case source lists are not all the same length, the result list will be the length of the shortest one.

**`reject($list, $value)`** *(Compass)*: removes `$value` from `$list`.

**`compact(\*$args)`** *(Compass)*: returns a new list after removing all the non-true values.

## Adding things to Sass lists

This is where things get very interesting. And quite complicated as well. I think the best way to explain this kind of stuff is to use an example. I'll use the same I talked about in [my Sass talk at KiwiParty](http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/07/01/feedbacks-kiwiparty/) last month.

Please consider an extended selector like `.home .nav-home, .about .nav-about, .products .nav-products, .contact .nav-contact` based on a list of keywords `$pages: home, about, products, contact`. I found 3 ways to generate this selector based on the list; we'll see them one by one.

But first, we will write the skeleton of our testcase:

```scss
$pages: home, about, products, contact;
$selector: ();

@each $item in $pages {
  /* We create $selector */
}

#{$selector} {
  style: awesome;
}
```

### The long and dirty way

This is the method I was still using a couple of weeks ago. It works but it involves an extra conditional statemens to handle commas. Please see below.

```scss
@each $item in $pages {
  $selector: $selector unquote('.#{$item} .nav-#{$item}');
    
    @if $item != nth($pages, length($pages)) {
      $selector: $selector unquote(',');
    }
}
```

Basically, we add the new selector to `$selector` and if we are not dealing with the last item of the list, we add a comma.

*Note: we have to use `unquote('')` to treat our new selector as an unquoted string.*

### The clean way

This one is the cleanest way you can use between the three; not the shortest though. Anyway, it uses `append()` properly.

```scss
@each $item in $pages {
  $selector: append($selector, unquote('.#{$item} .nav-#{$item}'), comma);
}
```

I think this is pretty straightforward: we append to `$selector` the new selector by explicitly separating it from the previous one with a comma.

### The implicit way

Probably my favorite version above all since it's the shortest. It relies on implicit appending; very neat.

```scss
@each $item in $pages {
  $selector: $selector, unquote('.#{$item} .nav-#{$item}');
}
```

Instead of using `append()` and setting the 3rd parameter to `comma` we implicitly do it via removing the function and using a comma right after `$selector`.

## Final words

<blockquote class="pull-quote--right">Having a very permissive can be complicated.</blockquote>

The three versions we saw in the previous section work like a charm, the one you should use is really up to you. You can also do it in some other more complicated and dirty ways.

Anyway, this shows why having a very permissive can be complicated. As I said at the beginning of this post, you can do pretty much whatever you want and if you want my opinion this isn't for the best.
